# Python-Scripts

( #ChangeHttp )

This was a script I wrote forever ago for a task at work. Basically there were a bunch of http references in their code base for one of the companies internal tools. They wanted to upgrade to ssl, and replace all of the http references with https. I don't recall much more of the context, but they wanted to ignore certain instances of http. 

I was tasked with going through the code base and replacing these references...

Of course I was not going to do this manually...
